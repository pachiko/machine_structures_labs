To obtain 10 TLB misses and 10 page faults, access virtual addresses with different virtual page numbers.
Only access a recurring virtual page number after 4 accesses from it.
Eg 0x00 (0b0000 0000), 0x20 (0b0010 0000), 0x40, 0x60, 0x80, 0xA0, 0x00, 0x20, 0x40, 0x60
The most significant 3 bits are the virtual page numbers.
