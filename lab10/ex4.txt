Q: What is different about the setup of the system in this question as compared to the setup in CAMERA? 
In particular, what are P1, P2, P3, and P4? 
If you watch closely you'll see that this simulation reports a much higher percentage of TLB misses
than random runs on CAMERA did. Why might this be?

A: The P stands for Process.
Every time a context switch happens, the TLB and page table gets invalidated.
The processes also do not reuse enough pages in TLB and page table before that happens.

Q:
Select all factors that would cause the simulation to show a lower TLB hit rate than our original model.
Multiple processes are running.
Running multiple processes requires the system to context switch.
Context switches invalidate the TLB.
