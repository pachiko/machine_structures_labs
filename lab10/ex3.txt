Q: 
Given your sequence of memory accesses from Exercise 2, can you find a change to a single parameter 
(e.g. TLB Size, Physical Memory Size, Virtual Memory Size, Page Size)
that would result in the same number (ten) of TLB misses but result in fewer than ten page faults?
Write down two parameters for which if each got individually changed (while all other parameters stay the same)
would result in ten TLB misses but fewer than ten page faults.
A: Increase physical memory size. Reduce page size.
