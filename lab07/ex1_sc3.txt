Scenario 2:

Program Parameters:
Array Size (a0): 128 (bytes)
Step Size (a1): 1
Rep Count (a2): 1
Option (a3): 0 (increment)

Cache Parameters:
Cache Levels: 2

L1:
Block Size: 8
Number of Blocks: 8
Placement Policy: Direct Mapped
Associativity: 1
Block Replacement Policy: LRU

L2:
Block Size: 8
Number of Blocks: 16
Placement Policy: Direct Mapped
Associativity: 1
Block Replacement Policy: LRU

Tasks:
Q: What is the hit rate of the L1 cache? The L2 cache? Overall?
A: 0.5, 0.0, 0.25.

Q: How many accesses do we have to the L1 cache total? How many of them are misses?
A: 32 accesses. 16 misses.

Q: How many accesses do we have to the L2 cache total?
HINT: Think about what the L1 cache has to do in order to make us access the L2 cache.
A: 16 times. All caused by L1 misses.

Q: What program parameter would allow us to increase the L2 hit rate, but keep the L1 hit rate the same?
A: Increase rep count.

Q: Do our L1 and L2 hit rates decrease (-), stay the same (=), or increase (+) as we 
(1) increase the number of blocks in L1, or (2) increase the L1 block size?
A: (1) L1 = , L2 = (2) L1 + , L2 =
